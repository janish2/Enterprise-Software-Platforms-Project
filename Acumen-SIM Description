Acument SIM, Acumen Supplier Information Management is my ESP project developed in ESP course in San Jose State University, Fall 2015. 
Acumen SIM is an application which is a platform for any organization who can use it for maintaining the supplier details from which they purchase the software/hardware products. 
This basically helps the organization to get best suppliers. 
For example, if an organization wants 100 computers, than they can simply use our application
and select the supplier they want and send it to approval to their Finance & Project manager. Once the approval is done the organization member can 
order the computers.
So basically this helps the employee to save lot of time in researching about the suppliers and also get the latest deails in the market.
